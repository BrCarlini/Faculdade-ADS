    <h3>Lose Youself</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Look
            If you had
            One shot
            Or one opportunity
            To seize everything you ever wanted
            In one moment
            Would you capture it
            Or just let it slip?
        </p>
        <p>
            Yo
            His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
            There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
            He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
            To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
            What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
            He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
            He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
            The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow
            Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity
            Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked
            He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
            He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
            It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
            He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
            Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
            Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
        </p>
        <p>
            You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
            You own it, you better never let it go
            You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
            This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
        </p>
        <p>

            This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
            You better

            His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
            This world is mine for the taking
            Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order
            A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem
            It only grows harder, only grows hotter
            He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him
            Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter
            Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
            He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
            But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
            These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
            They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
            So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
            Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da
        </p>
        <p>
            You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

            No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
            Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
            I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
            I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
            But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
            Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
            All the pain inside amplified by the
            Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
            Five and I can't provide the right type of
            Life for my family 'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
            And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
            This is my life and these times are so hard
            And it's getting even harder tryna feed and water my seed, plus
            Teeter totter, caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
            Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much
            For me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
            Gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
            To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
            Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
            Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
            So here I go, is my shot
            Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got
        </p>
        <p>
